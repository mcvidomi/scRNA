# About
Python framework for single-cell RNA-seq clustering with special 
focus on transfer learning (multitask/domain adaptation). This package contains methods
for generating and clustering (single task and multitask).

This software was written by Nico Goernitz, Bettina Mieth, Alex Gutteridge. TU Berlin, 2016.

# News
- First version that can be conveniently installed using the _pip install git+https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA.git_ 
command. Enjoy :)
- Command line script are available

# How to use
Basically, the software breaks down into 2 distinct parts: data generation and clustering.
After the installation using _pip_ is complete, there are
a couple of (bash) command line scripts that should be accessible from anywhere. Below are some examples and details 
for each of the parts. 

Calling those scripts without any parameter will give a short list of parameters and corresponding descriptions.

## 1. Generating Artificial Data 
scRNA-generate-data.sh

## 2. Clustering
Using scRNA-clustering.sh \\

### 2.1. SC3 and NMF Clustering

### 2.2. Transfer Learning
