# About
Python framework for single-cell RNA-seq clustering with special 
focus on multitask clustering. This package contains methods
for generating and converting data, clustering (single task and
multitask), and evaluation and visualization.

This software was written by Nico Goernitz and Bettina Mieth. TU Berlin, 2016.

# News
- First version that can be conveniently installed using the _pip install git+https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA.git_ 
command. Enjoy :)
- Command line script are available

# How to use
Basically, the software can be break down into 3 distinct parts: from data generation or conversion
through clustering to evaluation and visualization. After installation using _pip_ is complete, there are
a couple of command line scripts that should be accessible from anywhere. Below are some examples and details 
for each of the parts. 

## 1.a. Generating Artificial Data 
scRNA-generate-data.sh

## 1.b. Converting Existing Data

## 2.a. Single Task Clustering

(b) scRNA-nmf.sh

## 2.b. Multitask Clustering
